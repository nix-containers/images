{ mkImage, pkgs, lib, ... }:

# GENUINELY FIPS, unlike every other istio-*-fips image before this. It uses
# pkgs.istio-fips, which builds pilot-discovery from istio/istio source with
# CGO_ENABLED=1 and GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto, rather than pkgs.istio, which
# extracts a stock prebuilt binary out of the official release image. Extraction
# can never yield a FIPS artifact, which is why the compliance label is earned
# here and was removed from the images that only carried the name.
#
# Verify, do not assume:
#   go version -m /path/to/pilot-discovery | grep GOEXPERIMENT
# must report boringcrypto, and the binary self-reports
# GolangVersion:"goX.Y.Z-X:boringcrypto" under `pilot-discovery version`.
#
# THE EDGE IS STILL NOT COVERED. Envoy is C++; GOEXPERIMENT does nothing for it
# and it needs Bazel --define boringssl=fips against the frozen FIPS-validated
# BoringSSL. istio-proxy-fips and istio-envoy-fips remain stock upstream and are
# labelled accordingly. External TLS terminates in Envoy, so this covers the
# control plane, xDS and mTLS crypto — not the ingress gateway.

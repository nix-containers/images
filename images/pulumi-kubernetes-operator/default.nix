# pulumi-kubernetes-operator built from upstream source (v2.9.0).
#
# nixpkgs has no `pulumi-kubernetes-operator` package. This image must be a
# drop-in for the upstream one, because the chart sets AGENT_IMAGE to the SAME
# image it runs the controller from (templates/deployment.yaml). That means the
# image is used in three distinct ways and all three must work:
#
#   1. controller     - chart passes args ["/manager", "--leader-elect", ...]
#   2. bootstrap init - operator runs `cp /agent /tini /share/` from it
#   3. workspace exec - the copied binaries run as
#                       `/share/tini /share/agent -- serve ...`
#
# Hence: BOTH binaries, plus tini, plus upstream's exact entrypoint contract.
#
# Do NOT set entrypoint to the manager binary. The chart passes "/manager" as
# the first element of `args`, and operator/cmd/main.go parses flags with the
# stdlib `flag` package, which stops at the first non-flag argument. With
# entrypoint=[manager] the effective argv is `manager /manager --leader-elect
# ...` and every flag is silently dropped -- leader election off, metrics bind
# address left at "0". The operator still starts and reports healthy, so this
# fails silently. Match upstream's ENTRYPOINT ["/tini","--"] + CMD ["/manager"].

  # Top-level symlinks. /manager is what the chart's args invoke; /agent and
  # /tini are what the bootstrap init container copies out with

  # and the cloudnative-pg chart's /manager symlink.
  #
  # tini MUST be the upstream `tini-static` release binary, and this is not
  # a preference -- it has to satisfy TWO independent constraints that no
  # nixpkgs build of tini satisfies at once. /agent and /tini do not run in this image -- the bootstrap
  # init container copies them onto a shared emptyDir and the *workspace*
  # container execs them, and that container is a completely different
  # image (pulumi/pulumi:<ver>-nonroot, Debian-based) with no /nix/store.
  # A dynamically-linked tini carries an ELF interpreter of
  # /nix/store/<hash>-glibc-*/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, which does not exist
  # there, so the exec fails. Linux reports a missing ELF interpreter as
  # ENOENT, so the symptom is the maximally misleading
  #   exec /share/tini: no such file or directory
  # for a file that is present and executable. Observed on a live cluster
  # with the v2.9.0 build that shipped dynamic tini.
  #
  # CONSTRAINT 2 -- glibc getopt semantics. The operator's workspace command
  # is literally
  #     /share/tini /share/agent -- serve --workspace ...
  # with the `--` AFTER the program name. tini passes everything from the
  # first non-option onward to the child, so whether the child sees that
  # `--` depends on the libc's getopt: GNU getopt PERMUTES and consumes it,
  # POSIX getopt (musl) stops at the first non-option and preserves it. The
  # agent is a cobra CLI, and `agent -- serve` does not resolve the `serve`
  # subcommand -- it prints help and exits 0, so the workspace container
  # "Completed" successfully while serving nothing and the Stack hangs.
  #
  # This rules out pkgs.pkgsStatic.tini, which is musl. Measured:
  #     glibc tini -> child argv: serve --workspace X
  #     musl  tini -> child argv: -- serve --workspace X
  # The upstream release binary is static AND glibc-built, so it satisfies
  # both constraints. It is also exactly what upstream's own Dockerfile
  # ships, which is the compatibility target.
  #
  # /agent needs no equivalent treatment: buildGoModule with
  # CGO_ENABLED=0 already produces a static binary, and it is exec'd
  # directly rather than through an option parser.
  #
  # tini is deliberately NOT listed in mkImage's `extraPkgs` below. Any
  # package passed there is a *direct* member of the base layer's
  # `copyToRoot`, and nix2container flattens direct copyToRoot members by
  # stripping their own store-path prefix (so e.g. tini's bin/tini would be
  # relocated to /bin/tini, and /nix/store/<hash>-tini-*/bin/tini would no
  # longer exist). This symlink's target is that literal, unrewritten store
  # path, so it must reach tini only as an indirect closure reference (via
  # this derivation), exactly like /manager and /agent reach pkoBin -- pkoBin
  # is likewise never a direct `extraPkgs`/`extraContents` member, only the
  # image's `drv`. Verified empirically: with tini in extraPkgs, /tini
  # resolved to a dangling symlink; removing it fixed the bootstrap `cp`.
  # Upstream tini release binary -- static, glibc-built. See the two
  # constraints documented above.

# istio-fips - Istio Go control-plane components built with BoringCrypto
# https://github.com/istio/istio
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM pkgs/istio. pkgs/istio extracts prebuilt
# binaries out of the official Istio release images, which are stock upstream
# builds using Go's default crypto. Extraction can never produce a FIPS
# artifact, so a -fips variant sourced that way is a name and nothing more.
# This package builds from istio/istio source with CGO_ENABLED=1 and
# GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto, the same mechanism the 286 genuinely-qualifying
# -fips images here use (see pkgs/cert-manager-fips).
#
# SCOPE. pilot-discovery (istiod) and pilot-agent are pure Go, so boringcrypto
# applies. The Envoy data plane is C++ and cannot be built this way; it is a
# separate Bazel build linked against the CMVP #5314 AWS-LC FIPS 3.1.0 module
# (see `envoy` below), fetched as a hash-pinned release asset.
#
# Verify a build with:
#   go version -m result/bin/pilot-discovery | grep GOEXPERIMENT
# which must report boringcrypto. A binary without that line is not a FIPS
# build regardless of what the derivation is called.

  # AWS-LC-FIPS Envoy, fetched by hash from a GitHub release.
  #
  # WHY NOT BUILT HERE. This is a ~60 minute Bazel build that needs network
  # access mid-build and its own clang/cmake/ninja/go toolchain, so it cannot
  # run in a nix derivation. scripts/build-istio-envoy-fips.sh is the exact
  # recipe and regenerates this artifact; the hash below pins it, so the IMAGE
  # stays reproducible from git even though the binary is a documented input.
  #
  # WHY NOT UPSTREAM ENVOY. Istio's data plane needs istio/proxy's build — the
  # bootstrap requires type.googleapis.com/istio.workload.BootstrapExtension and
  # the binary must carry io.istio.http.peer_metadata, io.istio.local_principal
  # and io.istio.peer_principal. Chainguard's envoy-fips is upstream Envoy and
  # rejects Istio's config; Google's ASM ships no FIPS variant; Tetrate's is
  # subscription-gated. Nothing publishes a FIPS Envoy Istio can use.
  #
  # THE MODULE. TLS crypto is the AWS-LC 3 Cryptographic Module (static),
  # version AWS-LC FIPS 3.1.0, NIST CMVP certificate #5314 (FIPS 140-3 L1,
  # Active, sunset 2031-06-04). libcrypto.a/libssl.a are built outside Bazel
  # exactly as Security Policy section 11.1 prescribes (Amazon Linux 2023,
  # "cmake3 -DFIPS=1 .. && make", from the unmodified AWS-LC-FIPS-3.1.0.zip,
  # sha256 fe408fa4...c9f1, `bssl isfips` = 1) and linked statically into
  # istio/proxy ce177c56 (istio 1.30.4's pin) with --config=aws-lc-fips.
  # Reports:
  #   ce177c56.../1.38.4-dev/Modified/RELEASE/AWS-LC-FIPS
  # and `nm envoy | grep awslc_version_string` shows T (statically linked).
  #
  # FIPS_202205 COMPLIANCE POLICY. AWS-LC has no SSL_CTX_set_compliance_policy,
  # and Envoy's AWS-LC compat shim stubs it to FAIL, which would reject any
  # listener carrying compliance_policies: [FIPS_202205]. The build applies a
  # small Envoy-only patch (scripts/istio-envoy-awslc-fips/0014-*.patch; the
  # module is untouched) that implements the policy with public AWS-LC APIs:
  # TLS >= 1.2, TLS 1.2 ECDHE-*-AES-GCM only, TLS 1.3 AES-GCM only (no
  # ChaCha20), P-256/P-384 only, no SHA-1/Ed25519 signatures. Not emulated:
  # AWS-LC cannot REQUIRE extended master secret.
  #
  # OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. #5314's tested OE is Amazon Linux 2023 on
  # c6i.metal / r8g.metal-24xl; no vendor-affirmed OEs. Running on GKE
  # (Container-Optimized OS, x86_64) rests on USER affirmation under the
  # FIPS 140-3 Management Manual 7.9.2 ("another compatible operating
  # system"). CMVP makes no statement about operation on unlisted OEs.
  #
  # autoPatchelfHook IS LOAD-BEARING. The Bazel build emits a binary requesting
  # /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, absent in a nix image. Without patching,
  # pilot-agent fails with "fork/exec /usr/local/bin/envoy: no such file or
  # directory" — ENOENT for the missing INTERPRETER, not the missing file, which
  # is thoroughly misleading. Patching rewrites the ELF interpreter/RPATH only;
  # the module's integrity check covers its own .text and still passes (Envoy
  # aborts at startup if the FIPS power-on self-test fails).

  # jwksUri is added, and it would surface as a TLS verification error rather

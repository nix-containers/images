# Override nixpkgs vector: bump to 0.56.0 ahead of nixpkgs 0.55.0.
#
# Why an override rather than a flake.lock bump:
#   As of 2026-06-17 nixos-unstable HEAD (rev 567a49d1) still pins
#   vector 0.55.0; there is no nixos-unstable revision shipping 0.56.0
#   yet (no nixpkgs PR open either). Bumping the channel would not
#   deliver 0.56 and would churn unrelated packages.
#
# Why the upstream prebuilt:
#   Vector is a large Rust workspace (~140 crates) with native deps
#   (openssl, rdkafka, oniguruma, etc.). The upstream musl tarball is
#   a static-pie binary, so we avoid rebuilding it from source and
#   keep the diff focused on this one package. Same pattern this repo
#   already uses for pulumi (see ../pulumi/default.nix).
